# Cyberpunk 2020 Referee tool 

## In progress

Basic idea for this project is to have some kind of tool for
the referee of Cyberpunk 2020 game to keep track of things
in easier way, roll results/effects quickly and
have some quick way to check info on e.g. skills.

## Features:

- Stun checks based on damage
- Roll stun effect
- Damage calculation based on body type modifer
- Determine hit locations
- Fetch character info from DB
- Keep track of combat sequence order for one combat session
